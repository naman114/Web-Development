// What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a NoSQL document oriented database written in C++

// Specifics
To be document oriented means it stores data as documents
-Data is stored as BSON (Different from JSON as we have to write the data types as well)
-Here,
    Database = Database
    Tabes = Collections
    Rows = Documents
    When compared to a relational db like SQL

// Working
`mongod` is the host process for the database
`mongo`  is the command line shell that connects to a specific instance of mongod
Running the command `mongo` defaults to connecting to the localhost on port 27017

// Downloading
Search for `mongodb downloads center`
Navigate to community server and download
Uncheck Install MongoD as a service (Run MongoD manually on PC and as a service on the server)
Install MongoDB Compass
After installation, create data/db inside C drive
Create Path variable for ProgramFiles/MongoDB/server/5.0/bin
Right click windows icon > Open powershell as admin
The mongo command won't work directly without a mongod host process
Run mongod 
Open a new PS instance
Run mongo

// Basic usage of the shell
$ db
test // default db is test

$ use mydb
switched to db mydb // If not present, it creates the db you mention after use

$ use test
switched to db test

$ show dbs
admin
config
local

$ show collections
// No output as nothing is present

$ db.text // Create a collection

$ show collections
// No output as collection `text` has nothing in it

$ db.text.insert({}) // Insert an empty document

$ show collections
text

$ show dbs
// Will now show your db also

$ db.text.insert({"name": "Alice"})
